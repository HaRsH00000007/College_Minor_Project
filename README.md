ðŸ§  Amazon GenAI Recommender System (Cross-Selling Engine)

A Generative AIâ€“powered product recommendation system that redefines how e-commerce cross-selling works.
Unlike traditional machine learning models, this system leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) and vector similarity to recommend products semantically related to user searches â€” mimicking the intelligence of Amazon-style recommendations.

ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ§© Core Highlights

Vector-Based Recommendation Engine â€“ Embeds product descriptions into semantic space and finds the most similar ones.

LLM-Powered Understanding â€“ Uses Transformer architectures to understand product meaning beyond keywords.

Cross-Selling Optimization â€“ Suggests complementary items, not just similar ones.

Next.js Frontend + FastAPI Backend â€“ Modern full-stack architecture for scalability and simplicity.

High-Performance Inference â€“ Supports Groq API, HuggingFace, or local embedding models for vector generation.
